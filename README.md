# ETLSchedulerSim
A bank transactions &amp; ETL scheduling simulator made during an internship in a Tunisian banking system. It's basically an attempt to simulate near real-time datawarehousing and to optimize the TX lifecycle within the banking system. Technologies used in this project are: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Cloud (+ Zipkin), Spring Security (+ LDAP), Thymeleaf, Vaadin, PostgreSQL &amp; OpenLDAP (as databases for storage and authentication) &amp; Spring Batch. Hopefully, someone would find this project useful someday. PS* possibility of opensourcing this project whenever the first version of it comes to light.
